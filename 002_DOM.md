# Introduction to Document Object Model or DOM
In short, a Document Object Model (DOM) is a way to conceptualize contents of a web *document*.

Early versions of JavaScript offered developers the ability to query and change some of the actual contents of web documents&mdash;mainly images and forms, and so **images** and **forms** had been predefined in JavaScript. 

- The following line addresses the third image in the document:
```
document.images[2]
```

- The following line calls the form named "details":
```
document.forms['details']
```

# What is DHTML?

DHTML is short for Dynamic HTML. Not a technology in and of itself, DHTML was shorthand for describing the collective usage of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Web Development:

- HTML to markup your web page into elements.
- CSS to style and position those elements.
- JavaScript to change those elements and styles on the go.

**Note:** DHTML can be understood as a *stack* of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Example of DHTML

The following line defines an element with id "myElement" in HTML:
```
<div id='myElement'>This is my element.</div>
```

And the following line defines the style (here positioning) in CSS for the HTML element with id "myElement":
```
#myElement {
    position: absolute;
    left: 50px;
    top: 100px;
}
```

Then, we can utilize JavaScript to change the left and top styles of myElement and move it around the page, which we will cover in later sections.

**Note:** Although, intially, DOMscript was extremely fragmented, with each browser its defining its own scripting, now most of Web Design has been standardized and all browsers support the standard DHTML stack.

The W3C defines DOM as "A platform- and language-neutral interface that will alow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of documents."

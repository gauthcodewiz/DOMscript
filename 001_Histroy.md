# A Brief History of JavaScript
## Introduction
This is an exciting time to be a web designer. in recent years, web design has evolved from its chaotic, haphazard roots into a mature design descipline. Designers are adopting a standards-based approach to buildingwebsites, and the term **web standards** has been coined to describe the technologies that enable thi approach.

Whenever designers discuss the subject of web stadards e**X**tensible **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage or XHTML and **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets, CSS usually take the center stage. However, there is a hidden hero amongst the web-design principles, approved by the **W**orl **W**ide **W** **C**onsortium called **W3C**, which is supported by all standard web browsers, known as the **D**ocument **O**bject **M**odel or **DOM**. The DOM allows a web designer to add interactivity to the documents in much the same way that CSS allows for adding styles.

Before looking at the DOM, however, let us first examine the language that we'll be using to make our web pages interactive. The language is JavaScript, and it's been around for quite some time.

## The Origins of JavaScript
Like said before, the origins of web design were rather haphazard and several companies and products were launched before these principles were standardized.

- JavaScript was developed by Netscape in collaboration with Sun Microsystems. 
- Before JavaScript, web browsers were fairly basic pieces of software capable of displaying HyperText documents. 
- JavaScript was later introduced to add some extra spice to web design. The first version, JavaScript 1.0 debuted in Netscape Navigator 2 web browser in 1995.
- Before JavaScript 1.0 was released, Netscape Navigator was the major browswer.
- Microsoft also released its web browswer, the Internet Explorer, along with their own VBScript language which came with Internet Explorer 3.

## Standardization of JavaScript

As a response to VBScript Netscape and Sun Microsystems set about standardizing the langauge together with the European Computer Manufacturers Asssociation (ECMA). The result is known as ECMAscript, yet another name for JavaScript, which however didn't stick on much.

**Note:** JavaScript has nothing to do with Java, which is a programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. JavaScript was originally going to be called LiveScript. It is an important discussion as Web Design utilizes both Java and JavaScript.

JavaScript is a scripting language. This means that unlike a *program* that does everything itself, JavaScript simply tells the web browser what to do. The web browser interprets the script and does all the work. Thus it would be unfair to compare JavaScrpt with languages like C++ and Java.
